## Discord Bot Templates

ASP.NET's [Generic Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-2.2) decouples the HTTP pipeline from the web host API, making it available for use in many other contexts. These templates set up your discord bot as a hosted service, allowing you to easily access quality of life features like logging and configuration extensions, as well as dependency injection. 

Currently there are templates for:

- Discord.Net
